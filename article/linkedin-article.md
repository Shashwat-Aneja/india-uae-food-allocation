**Title:** Bridging Surplus and Need: A Compact Design for India–UAE Foodgrain Allocation

Food security in the Gulf is perennial, while India — one of the world’s largest agricultural producers — periodically experiences regional surpluses. This compact, design-first prototype models how surplus foodgrain from India can be matched to demand in the UAE using a deterministic allocation engine, transparent pricing formulas, and a clean UI for stakeholders.

Highlights:
- Predictable matching using numeric surplus/demand inputs.
- Transparent landing cost per tonne (base price, transport, storage, tariffs).
- Simple allocation score to rank candidate shipments and select cost-effective options.

If you want to test the model with sample logistics rates or discuss pilot uses with supply-chain stakeholders, I’m open to collaboration and ideas.
