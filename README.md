# India ↔ UAE Foodgrain Allocation — Compact Concept (Option A)

**One-line:** A design-first, logic-driven prototype that models how surplus foodgrain in India can be matched with the UAE's demand using decision logic, UI prototypes, and pricing simulations — no heavy coding required.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This is a theoretical, presentation-first project designed for academic, portfolio, and stakeholder pitch use. The repository contains a polished dashboard visual, architecture diagrams, pricing formulas, and supporting documentation — everything needed to present the idea and logic behind an India→UAE foodgrain allocation channel.

**Core idea:** convert India’s regional surpluses into predictable, cost-optimized shipments to satisfy UAE demand while reducing waste and storage costs.
